        <p>Ragu alla Bolognese is a rich, slow-simmered meat sauce from Bologna, Italy, renowned for its depth of flavor and comforting heartiness. Traditionally made with a blend of ground beef and pork, finely chopped onions, carrots, celery, tomatoes, and a touch of milk or cream, the sauce is gently cooked for hours to create a velvety, deeply savory ragu. Unlike quick tomato-based sauces, Bolognese is all about the slow melding of meat, vegetables, and aromatics into a luxurious, thick sauce. Served with tagliatelle, layered in lasagna, or spooned over polenta, ragu alla Bolognese is a timeless expression of Italian culinary tradition and patience.</p>
